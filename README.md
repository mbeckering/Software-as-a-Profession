Software-as-a-Profession
UMSL Course

These projects were written for an UMSL capstone-type course called Software as a Profession.
Mostly Python (my first time using Python).
This course had a heavy emphasis on following specifications and writing well-formatted code with extremely thorough comments.
There were times when I would have liked to alter or improve a program's approach or presentation, but instead chose to adhere
strictly to the given specifications for each assignment.
